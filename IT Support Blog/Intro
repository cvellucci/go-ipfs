Hello!

My name is Snippy and I'm a pair of Scissors to teach you help you with IPFS.  Perhaps you know my cousin Clippy the paper clip.
IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a protocol for sharing data on the internet.  It's relatively new, having been introduced in 2016 and decentralizes data storage.

I grew up in the digital age.  I have never been afraid nor confused by computers, only intrigued.  I was the entire IT department for a small consulting firm before taking a position with a bigger firm.
I enjoyed my time there learning more about database systems and structures.  Unfortunately, my time there would be short before I would move on to become a system support engineer.  This got me back to basics!
I supported proprietary ad tech used by clients to buy/sell ad space on cable, television, and radio.  These clients needed their own server environments which they connected to through citrix to access their data and our software.
Between config files, programs, and servers, I was fascinated in the way everything connected and communicated together as one, which brings me to decentralization.

It's fairly easy to stand up a production environment or a test environment, but what about a decentralized environment? A "non-environment" if you will.  How does a central person create a DEcentralized environment or product!?
That concept fascinates me!  Decentralization technologies gives power to no one and everyone at the same time. Much like the internet in the early 90's, I think we're beginning to tap into the possibilities and benefits of decentralization.
I think we're all going to be learning a lot together as the whole world begins to adopt decentralized technologies for currency, storage, and more.
